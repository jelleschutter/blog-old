title: Weatherstation Project

# Weatherstation
In the autumn semester of 2020 we got the oppurtunity to make an weather monitoring station. The finalised project should be ready for use by a sailing club along the lake of Zurich.
## 
At the beginning of the semester we were provided with the hardware for the project: A Raspberry Pi and an 11 inch touchscreen display. Additionally we were given a software package to allow for easy importing of the weather data from the waterpolice of Zurich.
## Inheritance
By receiving a Python package for communicating with the data source, we sadly also inherited its flaws. Therefore our first task was repairing the provided software.
